Here’s an interface for the `User` model based on the code you provided. The `User` object likely contains fields such as `id`, `username`, `email`, `password`, `profileImage`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`. I’ll include fields commonly found in user models and their types.

### `User` Interface:

```typescript
// src/models/User.ts

export interface User {
    id: string;           // Unique identifier for the user
    username: string;     // Username for the user
    email: string;        // Email of the user
    password: string;     // Hashed password of the user
    profileImage?: string; // Optional profile image URL
    createdAt: Date;      // Timestamp when the user was created
    updatedAt: Date;      // Timestamp when the user was last updated
}

// This could be a partial interface for login response, excluding password.
export interface LoginResponse {
    accessToken: string;  // JWT Access token for the user session
    refreshToken: string; // JWT Refresh token to renew the session
    user: {
        id: string;       // User ID
        username: string; // Username of the user
        email: string;    // Email of the user
    };
}
```

### Explanation of Fields:

- `id: string`: A unique identifier for each user, usually a UUID.
- `username: string`: The username chosen by the user.
- `email: string`: The user's email address, used for login and communication.
- `password: string`: The user's password (stored as a hash for security).
- `profileImage?: string`: An optional field for storing the URL or path to the user's profile image.
- `createdAt: Date`: The timestamp for when the user was first registered.
- `updatedAt: Date`: The timestamp for when the user details were last updated.

### Usage:
This `User` interface would be used throughout your app wherever a user object is referenced. The `LoginResponse` interface is for the API response when a user successfully logs in, returning both tokens and basic user details.
