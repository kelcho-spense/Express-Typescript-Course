# Express.js Curriculum

This repository provides an in-depth curriculum designed to teach the fundamentals and advanced topics in Express.js, a popular web framework for Node.js. It covers creating an Express.js app, proper folder structure, middleware usage, routing, JWT authentication, and much more.

## Project Overview

The repository contains the following key sections and topics:

### 1. Introduction
- **What is Express.js?**  
  Overview of Express.js and how it simplifies building web applications in Node.js.
- **Why Express.js and not Node.js?**  
  A comparison between using pure Node.js versus using Express.js for building web servers.
- **What Can Express.js Do?**  
  The capabilities of Express.js and why it's a popular choice for backend development.

### 2. Get Started
- **Creating an Express App**  
  Step-by-step guide on how to initialize and create an Express app.
- **Frameworks built on Express**  
  Overview of other frameworks like NestJS, Koa, etc., built on top of Express.
- **Proper Express Folder Structure for REST API**  
  Organizing your code for scalability and maintainability, including:
  - Model, Routes, Controllers, (config, middleware, schema, utils, types, etc.)
  - Adding Services (optional for complex apps)

### 3. App Object (Express Object)
Understanding the `app` object provided by Express and how to define routes:
- **app.get()**: Define GET routes
- **app.post()**: Define POST routes
- **app.put()**: Define PUT routes
- **app.delete()**: Define DELETE routes
- **app.patch()**: Define PATCH routes
- **app.use()**: Define middleware usage

### 4. Request Object
- **What is the Request Object?**  
  Understanding the `req` object in Express.
- **Request Object Methods**:
  - **Query Parameters (`req.query`)**: Handling query parameters.
    - Filtering, sorting, limiting, and pagination operations.
  - **Route Parameters (`req.params`)**: Handling route parameters for dynamic routes.

### 5. Response Object
- **What is the Response Object?**  
  Understanding the `res` object in Express.
- **Response Methods**:
  - **res.json()**: Send JSON response.
  - **res.status()**: Set HTTP status codes.
  - **res.send()**: Send response data.
  - **res.redirect()**: Redirect request to another route.
  - **res.download()**: Send file download.
  - **res.end()**: End the response process.

### 6. Routing (express.Router)
- Using the `express.Router` object to modularize routes in your app.

### 7. Serving Static Files
- Serve static assets such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files using Express.

### 8. Middlewares
- **Inbuilt Middleware**:
  - **express.json()**: Parse incoming requests with JSON payloads.
  - **express.urlencoded()**: Parse incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads.
- **External Middleware**:
  - **express-rate-limit**: Implement rate-limiting to protect against DDoS attacks.

### 9. Schema Validation (ZOD)
- Use **ZOD** for validating and parsing request data schema.

### 10. JWT Authentication
- **Token Creation**: Generate JWT tokens for secure communication.
- **Authorization**: Secure routes based on user roles and permissions.
- **Authentication**: Validate JWT tokens for protected routes.

### 11. Password Hashing with Bcrypt
- Use **Bcrypt** to hash passwords before storing them in a database.

### 12. API + DB Integration
- **MSSQL**: Using Express.js with a SQL Server database.
- **PostgreSQL**: Using Express.js with a PostgreSQL database.

## Express.js + ORMs
- **Drizzle ORM**: Simplified interaction with databases using Drizzle ORM in Express.js.

---

## API Project: User Management API
A sample project showcasing how to build a user management system with Express.js:
1. **CRUD Operations**: Manage user profile data (create, read, update, delete).
2. **Admin Panel**: Administrative functionality to manage user accounts.
3. **JWT Auth with Token Creation**: Handle authentication with JWT tokens.
4. **Authorization & Authentication**: Secure routes based on user roles.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **ZOD**: Schema and object validation.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication.
- **Bcrypt**: Library for password hashing.
- **MSSQL / PostgreSQL**: Databases for persisting data.
